# A Tribute Page for Luna
This a tribute page I created for my dog Luna. She passed away on December 16, 2022. Sadly, it was the day before I was returning to the States and I did not get to say goodbye. This page is a modified version of the ["Birthday GIFt Site"](https://scrimba.com/playlist/pdYWBhW) from the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) coursework.
